    project titled The Phoenix. His musical performance ranges from Baroque to Contemporary to the Jazz tradition, 
    and his compositions reflect this breadth of history backed by a rigorous classical training. 
    His own works also feature a particular fascination with abstract ancient imagery, representations of birdsong, 
    and ancient Greek and Asian philosophy.
